  "Building a static 2-D platformer website with React, deployed using GitHub Pages";

I built this website as a 2-D game platformer to have a creative outlet for my coding. In the beginning, I kept it simple with plain old vanilla HTML / CSS / JS.
This approach was nice to focus on creating fun features, learning the fundamentals of the web again, and not wasting time worrying about problems with npm packages and SPA frameworks.
My website consisted of:

- a simple HTML template that contained a single &lt;canvas&gt; element
- an index.js file that contained all of the game logic

However, this approach became exponentially more difficult to manage as the website grew. My index.js became a monolith, ballooning to almost 2,000 lines of spaghetti code. Having everything in one file sucked for many reasons:
1. Any change involved scrolling between distant parts of the file.

    The length of the file made it harder to keep context on what inputs / outputs a function needs and what I'm trying to accomplish. I would constantly be scrolling back and forth, or using a split screen to make changes.

2. CTRL + F works better when code is broken up 

    Since everything was defined in index.js, I would get 30+ matches when CTRL+F-ing a common keyword. If files were broken up, I'd usually only have less than ten matches to sift through, which is much more manageable.
    github pages only serves static html css js.
