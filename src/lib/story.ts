  "I'm Luke Muehring, a climber, software engineer, and creative person. I'm currently based in Salt Lake City.",
  "Check out the blog in the menu for my thoughts, trip reports, and notes on coding.",
  "Here's what I've been working on recently.",
  "Let me tell you a little bit about myself, starting with my software engineering career.",
  "For the past three years, I’ve been building a diverse range of full stack applications in big tech and healthcare.",
  "I also enjoy being creative, which is why I graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Computational Media, created this website, and built a lot of my projects from scratch.",
  "After graduating college, I moved to Seattle to work as a software engineer for Microsoft. I was fortunate to start my career  with a solid foundation of engineering practices like thorough code reviews, test driven development, and documenting complex systems.",
  "At the same time, I was competing in the professional circuit for competitive rock climbing. It's a hobby-turned-passion that I began in highschool and haven't given up since. As I got better, I began to believe more and more in my potential as an athlete. Then, during my second year at Microsoft in 2023, I made the US Team after ten years of climbing. I wondered how good I could get if I focused entirely on my climbing, especially with the 2024 Olympics around the corner.",
  "Juggling two professional careers at the same time would have been possible - I've had to balance both climbing and academics from high school to college (going to Georgia Tech did not help). But to reach the level of success I envisioned, and to have a shot at qualifying for the freaking Olympics, I had to go all in. I left Microsoft. And I moved to Salt Lake City, where the strongest climbers in the US train. ",
  "I focused entirely on preparing for elite climbing competitions - regular double sessions, 5.14 spraywall circuits, and hours teasing out micro beta on slabs. It was grueling but satisfying. I was chasing a dream I had always been curious about, and I got to do something I love.",
  "I experienced some interesting ups and downs. I fell short of qualifying for the Olympics, but I got to place top 3 at the US National Championships and ranked in the top 50 worldwide. I was also in amazing shape, although I had developed some injuries from overtraining. More importantly, my cash runway was getting dangerously close to my emergency fund. I wanted to regain the  balance I had between my software engineering and my climbing, and apply the discipline and problem-solving skills I developed as an athlete.",
  "I created the website you're looking at, and another for a beach house rental business for ocean-front vacation experiences. Currently, I'm building full stack applications for Revere Health, Utah's largest physician group. It's a much smaller team than what I had at Microsoft, which comes with its own vibe. I like how most of my day is creating features and working directly with the people who use them.",
  "Besides full-stack development, I'm interested in creative coding. I love working on this website, and I've got a few ideas for projects I'd like to realize (VisionOS app development, and an app to help with journaling and organizing thoughts)",
  "Outside of work, I'm climbing and exploring outside. Utah's epic mountains offer endless adventure with ridgelines, trad climbing, and incredible nature right in my backyard. My current big outdoor project is training for an alpine style WURL, a 36-mile ridgeline traverse with 18,000+ feet of elevation gain, no preplaced stashes for food and water, and in one continuous push.",
  "If you have an idea to do something cool or want to talk, I’d love to get to know you better, so feel free to reach me using the email in the menu.",
  "Thanks for coming to my TED talk, I'm going to jump off a cliff now.",
