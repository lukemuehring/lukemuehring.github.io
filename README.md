- [This MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Tilemaps/Square_tilemaps_implementation:_Scrolling_maps) also helped explain scrolling tilemaps and camera movement
- Thanks you to Anokolsia for the pixel art for floor tiles at [this website](https://anokolisa.itch.io/basic-140-tiles-grassland-and-mines)

# TODO

## FUNCTIONAL

- all text -> HTML or fix the resizing issue for the restandrelaxvacation project
- Expand the design process of the rest and relax website
- Responsive Scaling? It's not working properly.

## ENVIRONMENT / ARTWORK

- artwork for the seattle arc, climbing and utah arc, lazy load photos
  add goals, where do you see yourself in the future, why do you tick
  what’s on your reading list right now
  what are you working on right now, and your aspirations…

## NICE TO HAVE FEATURES

- Click and drag player, animate player jumping to coordinates
- Mouse effect happens everywhere, not just on the player
- Night mode

## EXTRA ENGINEERING SAUCE

- Hit Count
- Weather based on weather in salt lake city
- chatbot integration that can tell people information about myself given a prompt ("Does Luke know C#?")
